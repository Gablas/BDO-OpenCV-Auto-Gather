# BDO-OpenCV-Auto-Gather
Cleanup coming soon.
## Quick Summary
### Goal
Automate game activity without injection.
### Solution
Use OpenCV and Machine Learning to visually analyse game. Act on analysis. The more human like the better.
### Description
With OpenCV I was able to create a machine learning model that could find a specific type of mob in Black Desert. Then with pyautogui and pydirectinput create human like movement which takes the character from the current position to the mob.
It is fully autonomous.
